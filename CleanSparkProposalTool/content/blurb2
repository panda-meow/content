THE PROCESS:

Up to this point, the tool was being ran manually each time by the engineer, and he was familiar with the data sets and fields that would be required or optional. So I discussed with the engineer who initially designed the tool in order to gain a better understanding of what steps he takes and how each piece fits into generating the proposal.
