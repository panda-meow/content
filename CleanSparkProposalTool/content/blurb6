The greatest source of complexity was found within the options section. There were many options that are toggled off by default. When toggled on, there are further optional configurations. I decided since the users opt-in for this functionality, I would display them in a modal popup with default configurations in place. This way, the options are less overwhelming and isolated from irrelevant options.
