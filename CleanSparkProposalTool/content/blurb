~When a client wants to know what renewable assets to add to their site in order to get the most cost-effective return on investment, we collect all of their utility data as well as building specifications. This data is then manually entered into a matlab tool and will return multiple options for the customer.

THE CHALLENGE:

Take a tool created by an engineer in MatLab used to project savings and suggest additional renewable assets to increase savings, and make it user-friendly and intuitive.
