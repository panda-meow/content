~When a customer wants to know their options for how to reduce energy consumption or overall energy costs, many things need to be taken into consideration. A historical set of utility data, the size of buildings and rooftop space that can hold solar panels, overall goals, and how quickly the customer would like to break even on the investmentâ€¦ just to name a few. Companies that provide these types of reports spend a lot of time manually entering this data, and tweaking parameters to end up with a few potential options. Due to the complexity of this task, the end result is a vague estimate, leaving customers frustrated when the result is far from the proposal calculations. Our company wanted to not only streamline this process, we wanted to account for everything down to tax credits to provide a highly accurate report.
