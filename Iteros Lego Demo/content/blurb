~Energy management is abstract in nature, and therefore difficult to conceptualize without an applied demonstration. Naturally, this became problematic when our company wanted to demonstrate to potential investors how our software worked beyond screens. This lead us to come up with a small-scale community made from legos to show how our system balances and shares power, as well as integrates community renewables. This alone still did not tell the whole story.

The Challenge:  Augment our physical model by conceptually overlaying with a visualization of what is happening within the model.
