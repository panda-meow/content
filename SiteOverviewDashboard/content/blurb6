The site-level view looks at metrics that may be unimportant at an aggregatte site level - one comprised of many sites. Since this type of view must be scalable to allow for hundreds or thousands of individual sites on one screen,

Specifically, the facility’s power load and cost of power are appropriate high-level metrics for indicating if a closer look into the site’s performance is required.

The next piece was creating an aggregate facility view. This had to be scalable to allow for hundreds or thousands of individual sites, all visible on a single screen.

THE CHALLENGE: Develop a visualization that displays the ‘health’ of sites within a portfolio based on power usage and cost. This visualization must be scalable and allow for hundreds or thousands of individual sites, all visible on a single screen.
