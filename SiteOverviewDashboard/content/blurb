### Overview
<p>The current tools used for energy management often consist of proprietary software that the equipment manufacturers require with their devices. When a device needs to be configured at the facility, the equipment manufacterer usually charges by the sensor point. Most devices have numerous sensor points, and this can get expensive.</p>
<p> At Iteros, we developed a system that is equipment agnostic, and allows for the creation of equipment definitions from which new equipment inherits properties. This enables consistent configuration in a fraction of the time.</p>


### The Challenge
<p>Since no two facilities have the same energy assets, what is the simplest way to develop a system that is customized to the existing assets without having to setup a unique dashboard for every customer? Create a modular interface that adapts to each facilityâ€™s unique configuration of assets.</p>
