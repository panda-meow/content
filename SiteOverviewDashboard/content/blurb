~The current tools used for energy management often consist of proprietary software that the equipment manufacturers require with their devices. When a device needs to be configured at the facility, the equipment manufacterer usually charges by the sensor point. Most devices have numerous sensor points, and this can get expensive. At Iteros, we developed a system that is equipment agnostic, and allows for the creation of equipment definitions from which new equipment inherits properties. This enables consistent configuration in a fraction of the time.

THE CHALLENGE:

Since no two facilities have the same energy assets, what is the simplest way to develop a system that is customized to the existing assets without having to setup a unique dashboard for every customer? Create a modular interface that adapts to each facilityâ€™s unique configuration of assets.
