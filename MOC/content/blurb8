<p>Our company had a patent on the bottom-up implementation of the energy fractalgrid. View more details <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Fractalgrid.html" title="Here" target="_blank">here</a>. This screen represents the health of each microgrid.  It consists of the health of our individual components, as well as disk usage, cpu, etc. so that we can detect a possible system failure. We were generating detailed data, yet wanted a simplified view. I had each sensor point represented as a node. Upon updating with data, the node would become 100% opaque. Each second it was not updated, it would decrease in opacity. If the node reached 0% opacity and remained for more than three seconds, it would turn red, indicating data was no longer coming through to the system.
