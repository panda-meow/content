### Overview
<p>The Microgrid Operations Center (MOC) collects data and processes information 24 hours a day. The MOC collects data from devices, whether they are monitoring one or more generation components, or controlling microgrids. While all of CleanSpark's installations are locally and autonomously managed and operated, MOCs are aggregation centers with vast amounts of storage and computing facilities.</p>

### The Challenge
<p>Design the room layout, device placement, and interfaces to allow for all facilities to be monitored and problems to be immediately highlighted.</p>
