Cleaning-up messy existing code written by a temp agency was absolutely necessary in order to re-design the interface. Ultimately, I had to develop to allow for additional features to be seamlessly integrated and easily accessible.</p>

<p>This is what I had to work with. I was hired as the third member of a software team that specialized primarily in embedded control systems. It was my job to take a platform in its infancy and determine the best way to display the data, emphasizing the importance of the interface. Modifying existing code was absolutely necessary in order to re-design the UI. Ultimately, I developed new code that allowed for additional features to be seamlessly integrated and easily accessed.</p>
