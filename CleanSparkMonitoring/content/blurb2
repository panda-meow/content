This is what I had to work with. I was hired as the third member of a software team that specialized primarily in embedded control systems. It was my job to take a platform in its infancy and determine the best way to display the data, emphasizing the importance of the interface. Modifying existing code was absolutely necessary in order to re-design the UI. Ultimately, I developed new code that allowed for additional features to be seamlessly integrated and easily accessed.
