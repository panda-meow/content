This is what I had to work with. When I came on board, I was hired as the third member of the software team, and the only front-end developer. My task was to take a platform in its infancy and determine the best way to display the data. Cleaning-up messy existing code written by a temp agency was absolutely necessary in order to re-design the interface. Ultimately, I had to develop to allow for additional features to be seamlessly integrated and easily accessible.
