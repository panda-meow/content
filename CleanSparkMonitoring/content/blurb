~The energy industry has outdated energy monitoring platforms that have not been updated since the 1970s. These platforms are designed for engineers, and have a high learning curve. CleanSpark wanted to update this interface by making it easy on the eyes and clear to understand for both engineers and general consumers.

THE CHALLENGE:

What is the most effective display for an energy monitoring energy within one facility containing various resources, while allowing for a drill-down into each resource?
