<p>The energy industry has outdated energy monitoring platforms that have not been updated since the 1970s. Most control system monitoring tools use a native application to display system information. These native apps require technicians to install very expenive proprietary software. Furthermore, these platforms are designed for engineers, and have a high learning curve. CleanSpark wanted to update this interface by making it easy on the eyes and clear to understand for both engineers and general consumers.</p>
