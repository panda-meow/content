We discovered yet another use case: the superuser. These would be clients that have multiple portfolios. One example could be a military base, where they aggregate buildings into groups to create a portfolio. In this scenario, interactivity should be minimal. The user wanted the ability to view multiple portfolios on one screen, and have it auto-advance because they did not want to have to interact with the screen to see more data. This brought forth the nested portfolio overview, containing a map of the sites, an individual portfolio history slider that displays one portfolio at a time, the mix of renewables, load, and storage for the portfolio, as well as the breakdown within each site, and a realtime site overview slider with a polar area diagram showing specific assets that make up the breakdown.
