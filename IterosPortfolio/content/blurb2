The lobby has been beautifully reworked. Photographs of artificial lightning hang on the old black marble walls. The reddish ceiling is a glorious m√©lange of eastern iconography: unicorns, phoenixes, clouds, and other miscellaneous
exotica. Three-fingered hands, perhaps <em>mudra</em> inspired, metaphorically hold up the building.

At the same time, this is a modern building designed for millennial appreciation: A smart elevator system, a xeriscaped courtyard, lots of bike storage, and excellent access to public transport. 2.3 million pounds of rebar and 10,000
tons of concrete have made the building more resilient.
