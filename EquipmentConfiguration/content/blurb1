### The Process
<p>The whole development team (two backend and two frontend devs, one dev ops) worked together to figure out the flow of setting up a new site, starting with creating a new equipment definition. We had a brainstorming session and re-worked our model until the flow diagram made sense for all cases we identified at that time. Once this was finalized, I translated the sketches into a diagram, and then into screens.</p>
